The food we eat and the water we drink can't be turned into nutrition and supplied to the whole body without the spleen and stomach. The role that the spleen and stomach plays in the human can be compared to a food processing plant, and if that food processing plant doesn't work properly or have sufficient food suply, the body has to suffer from starvation, which further causes the person to look haggard and withered.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The third beauty acupoint - Taixi</h3>
                        <p>Let's analyze the name of it first. "Tai" means large size and great quantity. "Xi" means creek. Therefore, when combined, they roughly mean many creeks.

                        <p>Taixi is the fundamental acupoint of the Kidney meridian. Of human organs, the nature of the kidney belongs to "water," and it is the place where "water" is preserved. If the renal function is poor (the so-called kidney deficiency), and the "water" inside the body is unable to control the "fire," the results equate to excessive fire in heart. This person with excessive fire will have symptoms like insomnia, anger, thirst, constipation, dry skin, gloomy complexion, etc. If these symptoms are the case, beauty is out of the question!</p>
                        <p><span class="red-important">Taixi is the fundamental acupoint of Kidney meridian and it can be compared to the warehouse of Kidney vitality.

Moreover, Taixi is a major acupoint of supplying Qi and the frequent use of Taiqi helps the body to be filled with Qi to stay healthy.</p>

The depression between the Achilles tendon and the medial malleolus tip is Taixi. Taixi is also very simple to use: either by massage or moxa moxibustion.
